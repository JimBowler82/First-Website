      <h1>Hi, I'm James</h1>
      <p>I am 38 and live in Redditch Worcestershire.  As a former HGV class 1 driver, I am am now embarking on a new career path into coding & technology with the help of the <a href="https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/" target="_blank">School of Code</a>.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have been a HGV driver for most of the last 15 years, working in many industries, but most recently in Automotive which involved moving prototype and high value cars from manufacturers to test tracks & factories all over Europe - from the heat of southern Spain to the cold & snow of Swedish Lapland!</p>
    <p>For the last few years, however, I have felt the need to work towards a different career so have been studying Computing & IT with the Open University.  This has opened my eyes to many areas in computing but has given me a real taste for programming.  Being lucky enough to have gotten a place on the latest cohort with the the School of Code (SoC), the chance of moving into my dream career looks increasingly possible!</p>
    <p>Alongside my previous employment, I have been completing self-guided study for the last few years.  The Open University has taught me in the way of computing theory, from Object Oriented Programming, algorithms & data structures, to web technologies and the basics of software engineering.  With the the help of resources, such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, I have been able to learn about responsive web design with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.  Now, with the help of SoC, I can go on to learn the more advanced 'in demand' skills in addition to learning how to work in agile teams, manage projects and build presentation skills.</p>
